Beauty of Math

**Subject areas
infinity
fractals
alg.top

**Problems and methods
"Repeating decimals"
number theory
Estimating # primes
graph theory
box. combo stuff

->interdisciplinary
Generating functions (calculus/algebra->combo)
geometry->number theory
abstract algebra->number theory
algebraic combo (+special app of poly)
(analysis->number theory)

**"unifying theorems"
Unique factorization


1. cool problems, puzzles; self-contained self-sufficient subject gives tools to tackle problems
1.5. elegance of solutions
1.75 showing existence without finding an example
2. connections between different areas of math
3. grand unifying theories!
